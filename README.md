An application based on SpringBoot returning endpoints as json

I used :
- spring-boot-starter-web from org.springframework.boot
- gson from com.google.code.gson (to read the json file)
- junit-jupiter-api and junit-jupiter-engine from org.junit.jupiter (
for creating tests class)
- spring-boot-maven-plugin from org.springframework.boot (to build a project)

Design Patterns used:
- Model View Controller

Instructions on how to run your application:
- Look for instructions.md file
